# Efficient CNNs using passive Filter Pruning (ongoing)

# Python scripts 
The repository contains following scripts,
(a) Proposed_pruning.py:  To identify importance scores of the CNN filters in a given convolutional layer.



# Folders

(a) (VGGish, DCASE21_Net, VGG-16): scripts for pruning, fine-tuning of networks, (i) VGGish_Net, (ii) DCASE21_Net and (iii) VGG-16 network.

(b) (CIFAR-10 on VGGish, DCASE21_Net, VGG-16): scripts for pruning, fine-tuning of networks, (i) VGGish_Net, (ii) DCASE21_Net and (iii) VGG-16 network.

(b) demo_MNIST: A GUI demonstration of pruned and unpruned model predictions.


# Multiply-accumulate operations computations

To compute MACs, we use publicly available "nessi.py" script available at https://github.com/AlbertoAncilotto/NeSsi


# Python packages used to build framework
1. tensorflow
2. scipy
3. numpy
4. sklearn
5.tkinter
and others (please check import functions before running the codes)
